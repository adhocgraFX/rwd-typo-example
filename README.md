JoomFlex3.0
============

responsive Joomla! 3 template

JoomFlex uses an off canvas navigation pattern, inspired by David Bushell.

JoomFlex is a more liquid version of JoomSkeleton, by integrating Nathan Smiths unsemantic grid system.

JoomSkeleton, JoomFluid and JoomFlex are experimental and work in progress.
